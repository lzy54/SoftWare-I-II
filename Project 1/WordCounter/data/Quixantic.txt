You are right, but this is about Quixantic, the hero with 4700 HP, 329 armor, and 201 magic resistance. It has an unstoppable move, a shield, and can even go through walls. It has control abilities, and even a cooldown of only 1 second, costing just 15 mana. Changing stances can even refresh the cooldown of W, which deals true damage. Then, after armor and magic resistance are increased, it can gain skill haste, reducing the cooldown of Q, shortening its casting time, and then there's the increased attack damage. And for W, it's just ahhh.
